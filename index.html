            <p>I'm a computer nerd who likes <span title="I have a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate with MX Blues, a Poker II with Clears, and a Unicomp Classic Buckling Spring keyboard.">mechanical keyboards</span>,
                programming, video games and listening to music.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Redmond High School in June 2015 with a 3.4 GPA and I'm currently
                taking classes at Bellevue College. Last quarter, I got a 97% in my 
                Introduction to C++ class, 100% in Motion Graphics, and 102% in my
            Web Design class. <em>Woo! Extra Credit!</em></p>
            <p>
                I worked in:
                <ul>
                    <li>C/C++ <em>(Including the Arduino version)</em></li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>PHP <em>(Just a bit)</em></li>
                    <li>Python <em>(I prefer 3.x to 2.x)</em></li>
                </ul>

            <header>Ludum Dare 32 (2015)</header>
            <p><a href="http://ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a> is a "game jam" event where solo participants have 48 hours
             to make an entire game based off of the given theme. All of the code and art assets must be created from scratch. 
            I took this event as an opportunity to better familiarise myself with the Unity3D game engine (so that I could later use it for Hunt the Wumpus).

            <header>Hunt the Wumpus (2015)</header>
            <p>Hunt the Wumpus was an event where groups were assigned to work on their own "Hunt the Wumpus" games, based only off of the given criteria.
            My team placed 1st runner up in the competition.
            Our game used the Unity3D game engine, and was coded in C#. It also supported controller and touchscreen support.
            <a href="wumpus.html">I made a website to show it off.</a>
            <br />
            <em>While it has screenshots, you'll need the Unity Web Player to play it in-browser.</em></p>
