            <header>Who Am I?</header>
            <p>I'm a computer nerd who likes <span title="I have a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate with MX Blues, a Poker II with Clears, and a Unicomp Classic Buckling Spring keyboard. Ergodox soon.">mechanical keyboards</span>,
                programming, video games and listening to music.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Redmond High School in June 2015 with a 3.4 GPA and I'm currently
                taking classes at Bellevue College. Last quarter, I got a 97% in my 
                Introduction to C++ class, 100% in Motion Graphics, and 102% in my
            Web Design class. <em>Woo! Extra Credit!</em></p>
            <p>
                I've worked in:
                <ul>
                    <li>C/C++ <em>(Including the Arduino version)</em></li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>PHP <em>(Just a bit)</em></li>
                    <li>Python <em>(I prefer 3.x to 2.x)</em></li>

            <header>Internet X-mas Tree Project (Dec 2015)</header>
            <img alt="My Christmas tree. Very festive." src="images/xmas tree.jpg" />
            <p>
                For Christmas last year, we decorated our tree with a 20m strip of 
                individually-addressable RGB leds. I first made a python program to
                change the colors and patterns of the tree, then a web interface to
                control it. I didn't know any PHP before this, so I learned enough
                in the time of a few hours. I also wasn't familiar with Git before
                this, so I took it upon myself to learn that as well.

            <header>GBJAM 4 - Low Battery (August 2015)</header>
            <img alt="Low Battery Screenshots" src="images/lowbattery.jpg" />  
            <p>Made for <a href="http://www.gbjam.net/">GBJAM 4</a> a "game jam" themed around the style of the original GameBoy handheld. Like any other "game jam", everything had to be made from scratch,
            but this event had to be GameBoy themed. It must have the original GameBoy resolution of 160px x 144px, and use only 4 colors.
            For this project, I learned the MonoGame game engine, which is a open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4.x framework.
            While we were given 10 days for this game, I was on vacation for most of it. The game turned out to be very short, due to a lack of levels.

            <img alt="The title screen for Operation Peeps" src="images/operation peeps.png" />
            <p><a href="http://ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a> is a "game jam" event where solo participants have 48 hours
             to make an entire game based off of the given theme. All of the code and art assets must be created from scratch. 
            I took this event as an opportunity to better familiarise myself with the Unity3D game engine (so that I could later use it for Hunt the Wumpus).

            <header>Hunt the Wumpus (Feb - May 2015)</header>
            <img alt="Hunt The Wumpus Gameplay" src="images/wumpus.jpg" />
            <p>Hunt the Wumpus was an event where groups were assigned to work on their own "Hunt the Wumpus" games, based only off of the given criteria.
            My team placed 1st runner up in the competition.
            Our game used the Unity3D game engine, and was coded in C#. It also supported controller and touchscreen support.

            <header>Snake Game (Spring 2015)</header>
            <img alt="Snake Game PCB" src="images/snake.jpg" />
            <p>
                This project I made for my 2nd semester of Computer Science and Engineering. It's a 8x8 LED display and a controller with 6 buttons.
                I then programmed a game of snake to run on the Arduino, complete with a menu and high-score tracking (until it's turned off).
                The main controller board was custom made, designed in Fritzing and etched.

            <header>Raspberry Pi Clock</header>
            <img alt="THIS IS NOT A BOMB" src="images/notabomb2.jpg" />
            <p>
                Around the time when that kid got in trouble for bringing his disassembled clock to school, I decided it would be interesting to make my own spin on it.
                Using a Raspberry Pi, 16x2 LCD display and a real-time clock module (not shown), I created a clock which kept the time, even when the device was turned off.
                It also made it clear to anyone around that it was <strong>not a bomb</strong>.
