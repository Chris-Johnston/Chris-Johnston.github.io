[Official post on UWB website.](https://www.uwb.edu/news/june-2018/hackathon)

I contributed to my school's hackathon, by providing example code for
[Discord, Twitter, and Spotify bots in Python and C#](https://uwb-acm.github.io/Hackathon-Docs/Barebones-Repositories.html).
I also
[wrote up documentation and included relevant topics in our documentation.](https://uwb-acm.github.io/Hackathon-Docs/)
During the event, I lead the group of tutors to help participants with coding questions.
I also laser cut these trophies.

This event had an attendance of 100 students, and went from 9 AM - 10 PM.
During this time, groups of attendees learned how to create chat bots of their
own.
