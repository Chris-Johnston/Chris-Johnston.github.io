I figured that the current website needed some changes, and that it's been long enough that I've gone without working on it.
I tried to adapt the style sheet from the old website as close as I could to Jekyll's "Minima" style. I also wanted to keep existing links to the "Hunt The Wumpus" project alive.

I've never used a system like this before, so who knows if I actually maintain it. Either way, I like this functionality more than the older website.
