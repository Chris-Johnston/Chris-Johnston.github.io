I started making bots on Discord only a few months after joining the platform 
in 2016. Most are single-purpose applications that I just create for fun.
I either use the [Discord.Net][dnet] or [discord.py][dpy] libraries.

## Achievement Bot

This bot generates Xbox-styled achievement popups using Magick.NET.
At the time of writing, it's in nearly 200 servers with a total of 97,000 users.

## CSSBot and CSSBot_Py

Originally created for a Discord server for my friends and other CSS students
at my school, these bots provide some all-around utilities.

I had made CSSBot first, but since C# wasn't widely known in the group,
I made CSSBot_Py using Python so that others could contribute.
