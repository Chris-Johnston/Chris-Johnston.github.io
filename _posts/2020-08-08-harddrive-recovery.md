## Disclaimer

Hard drive recovery is no joke, and if there's serious stuff on the line I would leave it
to the professionals. I assume no responsibility if you end up permanently destroying your data
after trying the methods I used here.

## TL;DR

- I was _very_ lucky.
- Back up your data using best practices, and check that your backups are working.
    - A RAID 1 configuration does not count as two "backups".
    - Schedule and perform regular manual backups if necessary.
- Double check every power adapter before plugging it in.

# How I killed my hard drives

I'm sure you must be thinking, how could anybody destroy a hard drive by accident?
Surely no technical person could make such a big mistake? (I'm literally on the computer all day.)

When I was moving, I had to clear all of the stuff from my desk area.
This included the computer, monitors, all of the accessories and their power bricks. To drive my fancy headphones, I have an
amplifier, and to store my files, I have a NAS (Network Attached Storage). I was using a QNAP 2-bay unit which was configured
in a RAID 0.

I was very careful when moving. Anything with a spinning HDD was fully powered off, and I was very careful to move it
first before most other things. I distinctly remember buckling up both my desktop computer and the NAS in the car seats.
Towels were put over the monitors to prevent them from scratching. My entire rat's nest of cables was thrown into a huge bag.

The move went just fine. Once the Internet access was setup, I began to set up the desk again (but cleaner this time).
I plugged in everything and let it be, as I had other things to do.

A few weeks later, I was planning to set up a Plex server to run off of the NAS.

    ChrisJ: so my NAS had a static IP set
    ChrisJ: and you can reset it so that it just uses DHCP
    ChrisJ: buut I think I made it do a factory reset
    ChrisJ: and now it wants to wipe my hard drive before I can use it
    ChrisJ: luckily there's two that are mirrored

At first, I just thought that because of that IP addessing issue (I had changed my subnet range), that I would have to pull the drives out, let the NAS reest, and reload all of my data. A pain, but no big deal.

    ChrisJ: well ****
    ChrisJ: neither of these drives are spinning anymore
    ChrisJ: oh huh, the drives are in warranty
    ChrisJ: but I have to call their support line ðŸ™ƒ
    ChrisJ: **** my backup is super old
    ChrisJ: turns out I had a lot of data that was only stored on that NAS

So, my only backup (which was a USB 4TB drive) was super old.
In the time between the last time I backed up and then,
I had migrated *all* of my raw camera photos to the NAS.
And only the NAS.

    ChrisJ: wow. I think I just figured out why my hard drives died, turns out that I grabbed the wrong power supply from the giant bag of similar-looking power supplies I had
    ChrisJ: so the NAS seemed to work just fine, but that would explain why the drives died
    ChrisJ: 24V
    ChrisJ: so looking at the controller
    ChrisJ: there's a diode that looks a bit crispy

(This was a chat with other people, but I've just grabbed
the snippets that I said which form my timeline of events.)

    ChrisJ: this wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't move lol
    ChrisJ: and if my headphone amp and NAS didn't use the same barrel connector

A summarized timeline of events:

 - I moved and got settled after a few weeks.
 - My NAS wasn't working.
 - I thought that my NAS would require a factory reset, wiping all of the data.
 - I pulled the drives out to grab the data off, and found that they wouldn't spin when plugged in.
 - I discovered that my backups were months old and didn't contain important data.
 - Western Digital's warranty would *replace* but not *recover* the drives.
 - I discovered that I used the wrong power brick with the same barrel connector but double the voltage, and that
 one of the diodes on the board was now very crispy.
   - And given this, I doubt WD would replace those drives for free.
 - I was quoted $600-$1000 for data recovery of the drives over the phone.
   - Seemingly, I noticed that the moment you mention "RAID", despite this being a mirror, the prices go way up.


## Why didn't I notice sooner?

So, I used a power adapter with the same barrel connector but twice the voltage. Why didn't I notice this sooner?

Of course, I should have checked the power brick more
carefully. It was in a bag with many others, and I had
assumed that if the connector fit, then it was fine.

But still, why didn't I notice that immediately after plugging it in?
Where was the magic smoke? Why did the NAS still work with
double the voltage, but my drives didn't?

This is speculation, but I'm guessing that the NAS' compute
hardware is all regulated at a voltage that isn't 12V.
This voltage regulator must have a pretty wide range of inputs that it could handle, since the computer part of the NAS was fine. (In retrospect, it also seems that the 5V logic of the hard drive controller was fine too.)

As for the stuff that needs 12V, the hard drives and the NAS case fans, clearly that wasn't being regulated. Maybe it
drew too much current for a small regulator, and so they assumed that the power from the brick would be fine enough.
Once I noticed this error, I did observe that the fans were spinning faster and louder than before.

This I found to be frustrating. I would have preferred that
my NAS were zapped first, before my drives. Who cares if the
NAS compute dies, the storage is much more important!

# So, now what?

I was stuck with two dead hard drives that had been zapped
with double the voltage for several weeks.

Here were the options that I considered:
 - I could pay $600-$1000 (or more, or less) to have the drives professionally recovered.

    I think this option makes a lot of sense if I had business-critical data with a large monetary value.
    But these are only personl files. I wouldn't value them all at $1000, but I still wanted to have the original copies of photos that were saved there.

    I also was a few months away from starting my job,
    so I didn't have a source of income at the time.

- I could replace the drives with new ones.

    No.

- I could try to fix it myself.

    I have had no prior experience with hard drive repair
    or data recovery. I found a few approaches suggested online, which include removing some components that do power regulation, or swapping the controller BIOS chip.

    In addition, most professional places will ask that you
    do not attempt your own recovery, and will charge you
    more if they can tell that you have.
    (This makes total sense.)

The silver lining to this situation was that I didn't have to make a choice immediately. These non-functional drives
could act as paperweights on my desk for as long as I want.
(Though, supply of identical donor parts is a ticking clock.)

## What I tried

I really didn't want to fork out the cost of data recovery.

I panicked a bit for the first few days, and so I had decided to try some recommendations that I had seen online.

The most common solution that I saw for this situation is to remove the "TVS" diode. This is the same diode that was all crispy on the image shown above. This recommendation involves either desoldering or destroying this diode if it shows as shorted with a multimeter. When the input voltage exceeds some amount, this diode shorts the input voltage to ground, which saves the other circuitry on that voltage line.

There was one important detail that these suggestions usually didn't recommend, which is to also check the 0 ohm resistors before these diodes.
These resistors act as hardware fuses. If there's a problem
and too much current flows through, the resistor will break
the circuit and be open.

So, the combination of the TVS diode and 0 ohm resistor act as voltage regulation, and are easy things to try first.

I did not check the 0 ohm resistor (at first), so this didn't get me anywhere with either drive.

## Loss Mitigation

So after trying the low-hanging fruit, I had realized that
professional drive recovery would be the way to go.

But it was _so expensive._

And so, I let these drives sit on my desk and collect dust for a while.

While I let the drives sit around, I figured that I should
try other ways to mitigate this data loss. Maybe I _did_ have a copy of these files somewhere that I didn't know about?

### Disposable data

A large amount of the files on my NAS were no big loss.
Downloaded media, files, etc. that I could re-download
all over again.

A lot of smaller important files were already synced
very well. I use Nextcloud to sync stuff between a few
machines, the server, and my phone.

### Getting (some) of my photos back

I like photography, and so for some of my better photos I'll have them printed. This was the first place I looked for off-site backups.

The big problem is that RAW photos use up a lot of space,
so these were not as well synced.

#### Amazon Cloud

I used to use Amazon Cloud Storage, since I was already paying for Prime and it had a ton of storage. However, I stopped using it regularly because:
- the sync app handled merges poorly
- Amazon runs facial recognition on your photo library (creepy)
- no Linux client

Because of the image processing, I decided to remove most of my data from it. However, I still will sometimes print some photos because it's cheap and quick.

Amazon will let you re-download the photos that you upload
(assumed to be in the original quality?), but since I only had a small handful of the best photos uploaded, this only yielded a small fraction of results.

#### Costco Photo

Costco also does photo printing, and is my go-to usually.
It's a similar story, I only had the photos that I wanted printed uploaded to the site, not everything, and certainly not the RAW photos.

One important difference is that Costco does not let you (or does not make it easy) to re-download the photos as they are uploaded in the original quality.

You can download the thumbnails, but they are slightly compressed. [I wrote a TaperMonkey script to do this.](https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/CostcoPhotoCenterScraper)

The alternative that Costco offers is a Photo USB, which is just a flash drive with your files. I found that these files
seemed like they were of the original quality, but they still aren't the Camera RAWs that I really wanted. I paid $10 for the flash drive anyways.
