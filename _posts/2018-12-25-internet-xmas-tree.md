The Internet Xmas Tree has been a project of mine since 2015.
Since then, each year I've brought it back and made improvements
from the previous iteration.

I used a Raspberry Pi and some Neopixels to control my Xmas tree. This was exposed to the Internet and people were invited to customize the lighting of our tree.
