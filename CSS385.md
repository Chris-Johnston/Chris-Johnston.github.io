# Week 1 - 3/30/18

1. What happened?

    I joined in the class late, so I haven't done all that much so far.

    I started the first assignment, which was to follow and then modify one of the
    Unity tutorials. I've done one of these before, but not for a 2D Unity project.

    The tutorial that we had to modify was titled '2D UFO'. My repo for my 2D UFO
    project with modifications [can be found here.](https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/CSS385_2DUFO)

    I'm also trying out using the Unity3D editor on Linux Mint. Still seeing how that
    will turn out.

2. How did I feel about it?

    I thought that the example project was easy to follow. The biggest issue that I
    encountered was coming up with three unique modifications to make to the project.
    In my project, I added some additional graphics, platforms, and spawning behaviors
    of the pick-up items.

    Also, I'm glad that this class uses C#. I like C#.
    I'm also seeing how the Linux compatibility with Jetbrains Rider and Unity3D is,
    since I've only used Unity3D and Visual Studio on Windows before.

3. Why did I react that way, or why did it happen that way?

    I didn't run into much difficulty with Unity because I've done some work with it
    before. I also do a lot of C# work. I wish Unity targeted a newer C# language version.

# Week 2 - 4/6/18

1. What happened?

    We looked at the design considerations made by games and looked
    at how changes in games can result in very different outcomes.

    One of the ways this was done was with a card game.
    We were told to play the game "Slap Jack", then write down observations
    about it and make some amount of changes an attempt to improve the game.

    We also looked at some of the nominated games from the Independent Games Festival,
    broke them down into a set of criteria and
    compared them against others to find a game that was the most
    unlike the game we chose. I went with Factorio, which was nominated,
    mostly because I was already familiar with the game.

2. How did I feel about it?

    I thought that making modifications to an existing card game was a fun
    exercise in developing something in iterations. Doing this reminded
    me of developing "house rules" in Monopoly or other card games.

    I thought it was useful to take examples from games we are familiar with
    and use that for breaking down their components. The only downside to this
    was that a lot of the people in the class chose similar games. While this
    is fine, it meant that there wasn't a load of variation in the games that
    were explained.

3. Why did I react that way, or why did it happen that way?

    I enjoyed the example of adapting the card game, since it involved modifying
    a game I didn't like very much in the beginning and improving it to make it
    better. I liked the end result, I think it made the game just a _bit_
    better.

    I thought that it was useful to break down the IGF games by a set of criteria,
    but I wasn't sure about the exercise in finding the game that was
    the most _opposite_ the one we chose. While I found a game that was
    _different_ from my game, I cannot say for certain that it was
    different enough to be considered opposite.
