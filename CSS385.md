# Week 1 - 3/30/18

1. What happened?

    I joined in the class late, so I haven't done all that much so far.

    I started the first assignment, which was to follow and then modify one of the
    Unity tutorials. I've done one of these before, but not for a 2D Unity project.

    The tutorial that we had to modify was titled '2D UFO'. My repo for my 2D UFO
    project with modifications [can be found here.](https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/CSS385_2DUFO)

    I'm also trying out using the Unity3D editor on Linux Mint. Still seeing how that
    will turn out.

2. How did I feel about it?

    I thought that the example project was easy to follow. The biggest issue that I
    encountered was coming up with three unique modifications to make to the project.
    In my project, I added some additional graphics, platforms, and spawning behaviors
    of the pick-up items.

    Also, I'm glad that this class uses C#. I like C#.
    I'm also seeing how the Linux compatibility with Jetbrains Rider and Unity3D is,
    since I've only used Unity3D and Visual Studio on Windows before.

3. Why did I react that way, or why did it happen that way?

    I didn't run into much difficulty with Unity because I've done some work with it
    before. I also do a lot of C# work. I wish Unity targeted a newer C# language version.
