This is a site that I use to highlight projects that I've been working / have
worked on, when more than a README is needed.

This page is very inconsistently updated. To see what I'm currently working on
you'd be better of looking at
 [what I have posted on my GitHub page. Username: Chris-Johnston.][cjgithub]

Some projects of interest:
  - The Binary Keyboard. It's a mechanical backlit keyboard that types
  in binary. It also has a screen. [Git Repo][binkeyboardgit] [Build Log]({% post_url 2017-04-21-binary-keyboard-build-log %})
  - The Internet Xmas Tree. I used a Raspberry Pi and some Neopixels to control
  my Xmas tree. This was exposed to the Internet and people were invited to customize the lighting of our tree. [I later did (more or less) the same thing on the front porch.][patiogit]
  [Internet-Xmas-Tree Git Repo][xmasgit] [PatioLightsHost Git][patiogit]
  - Discord bots. I have a few, which are suited for different purposes.
    - I have some written in C# and Python(3.6) intended for
    collaboration with my peers and other miscellaneous utilities for our servers.
    [CSSBot C# Git Repo][cssbotgit] [CSSBot Python Git Repo][cssbotpygit]
    - Using Magick.NET, I made [a bot to generate xbox-styled achievement popups.][achievementgit]
    - I also have [contributed to the Discord.NET library.][dnetcontrib] I've done refactoring, unit tests,
      developed new functionality, and helped contribute to the documentation.
  - I made a minimal [reverse-engineered library for driving Chinese knockoff IOT lightbulbs using Wireshark.][bulbgit] Currently it can turn lights on and off in any color.
  - I'm [currently developing a Python library for assembling, disassembling and simulating the Motorola 68K processor][easier68k] to replace legacy software that was used at my school, with the goal of more flexible
  functionality and much better cross-platform support.
  - I contributed to my school's hackathon, by providing example code for
    [Discord, Twitter, and Spotify bots in Python and C#][uwbhacks-barebones]. I also
    [wrote up documentation and included relevant topics in our documentation.][uwbhacks]
    - I also [laser cut some trophies.][uwbhacks-trophy]
