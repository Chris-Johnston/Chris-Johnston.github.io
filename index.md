This is a site that I use to highlight projects that I've been working / have
worked on, when more than a README is needed.

This page is very inconsistently updated. To see what I'm currently working on
you'd be better off looking at
[what I have posted on my GitHub page. Username: Chris-Johnston.][cjgithub]

## Projects

{% include project_list.html %}

  - I [(occasionally) develop a Python library called Easier68k for assembling, disassembling and simulating the Motorola 68K processor][easier68k] to replace legacy software that was used at by school, with the goal of more flexible
  functionality and much better cross-platform support.

  - I contributed to my school's hackathon, by providing example code for
    [Discord, Twitter, and Spotify bots in Python and C#][uwbhacks-barebones]. I also
    [wrote up documentation and included relevant topics in our documentation.][uwbhacks]
    During the event, I lead the group of tutors to help participants with coding questions.
    - I also laser cut these trophies.

 - I worked in a team to make a game in my Introduction to Game Development class. [It's called Grappel, and can be found here. Try the web build!][grappel] We were voted as one of the most popular games in our class.
 
  - While I am not a web design expert, [this site uses my own Jekyll style, called names_are_hard, which you can find here.][names-are-hard]
