I am a University of Washington Bothell student who likes to make things in my spare time.

In terms of programming, I've worked with
- Arduino
- C++
- C#
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Java
- PHP
- Python
- SQL
- XAML
- XML

_And I'm probably forgetting something._

I enjoy using both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms for making things.

Please refer to [my Github page](https://github.com/chris-johnston) to check out some of the things I've made.
