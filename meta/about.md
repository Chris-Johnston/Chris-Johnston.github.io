I'm Chris, and I'm a software engineer.
This is the site that I infrequently update to
document the projects that I work on in my spare time.

I can be reached at: `chjohnston [at] protonmail [dot] com`
Please do not use this email for solicitation.

This site is hosted on GitHub pages and built with Jekyll, using
my own theme called `names_are_hard`.
[While it's mostly tailor-made for this site, it's publicly available on GitHub.](http://github.com/Chris-Johnston/names_are_hard)
